# Shell sort from Princeton Course
# Worst case: O(n^(3/2))
# Best case: accurate model hasn't been discovered

# Bad solution: with powers of two: 1, 2, 4, 8 ...
# Meh solution: with powers of two minus one: 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63 ...
# Best to do with 3x + 1: 1, 4, 13, 40, 121, 364 ...
	#meaning that you go over every three positions and then sort those three


# COME BACK TO SHELL SORT?
