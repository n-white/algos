// Write an algo such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and column are set to 0


var detectAndChange = function(matrix) {
	// Keep two cache arrays to track rows and columns to change
	var columns = [];
	var rows = [];

	// First iteration: find columns and rows to change
	for (var)
	// Second iteration: change rows to zeros
	// Third iteration: change columns to zeros
}

// SOLUTION IS PRETTY EASY SO NOT ACTUALLY CODING IT
